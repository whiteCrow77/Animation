# Aesthetics
minimalist visual language out-line shading using basic models run trough a shader pipeline

## Scene 
3rd Person view
- ruined walls(mental barriers) and towers(concrete, isolation) in a peaceful void
- (representative) breaks out of her tower
- goes looking for people who are also trapped
- when they meet freedom emerges and fog will disappear and more walls will be revealed
- all the freed people look a the obstacle with determination

- ## Sky Box
represents different moods should be dynamic
- animation options:
grease pencil parallax
time-lapse
- distant clouds and thunder
- stars
- distant galaxy's
- plain sky
- twilight

- ## Towers
- if there are cracks the person tried to get out but couldn't
- other wise it was too late
- made of a mixture of brick and concrete

- ## Hope*
hope is a whisps of light that morphs to the needs of the ones that poses it
*thoughts?*

# The finale 
the minimal aesthetic recedes to reveal a fully detailed view of the scene arcane inspired
