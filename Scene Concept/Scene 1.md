1.1
life less body sits in the inside of a dark tower
a small wisp of light (hope) will float about the body
1.2
the tower suddenly starts shaking 
the body becomes afraid making the light dim
stones fall
1.3
the body tries to put the wall back together panicked
tries to grab hope
the light disappears in his hands
